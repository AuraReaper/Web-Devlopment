# Web Development Learning Repository

This repository is a collection of my personal projects and exercises as I learn web development. I've been focusing on both frontend and backend technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node.js, and Express.js.

## Overview

This repository serves as a playground for me to experiment with different concepts, techniques, and frameworks in web development. I've organized my projects and exercises into separate directories to keep things organized.
